## 关于我

I am a creator, dedicated to expressing myself through my work. I love learning and have a deep interest in philosophy and cognitive science. I am somewhat introverted and tend to get nervous easily, so I am also learning to relax. I often contemplate the meaning of life, and in the end, I have come to realize that perhaps it is simply about living fully in each present moment.

> We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion.And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. —— “Dead Poets Society”

## 我正在做

### Research

My long-term research focus is human-AI co-creation—leveraging AI to enhance human creativity and produce more in-depth and meaningful works. At the same time, AI is revolutionizing traditional learning methods, and I am also exploring how teaching and learning might take on new forms in the AI era.

### Writing

I am developing courses on how to use generative AI. At the same time, I am organizing the course content into a book, which I plan to publish in the future.
